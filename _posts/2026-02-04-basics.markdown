# Hacking Basics

# 1. Network Fundamentals

## The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is the standard for how different computer systems communicate.

| LAYER | NAME | UNIT | WHAT HAPPENS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | Application | Data | HTTP, DNS, SMTP (The UI/UX level). |
| 4 | Transport | Segments | TCP (reliable) and UDP (fast). Port numbers live here. |
| 3 | Network | Packets | IP addresses. Routing data across different networks. |
| 2 | Data Link | Frames | MAC addresses. Connecting two physical devices on a LAN. |
| 1 | Physical | Bits | The actual cables, fiber optics, or Wi-Fi radio waves. |

## Packets vs Frames

- **Frames (Layer 2):** Think of this as an envelope used to move data inside a single building (LAN). It uses **MAC addresses**.
- **Packets (Layer 3):** Think of this as the mail that goes across the country. It uses **IP addresses**.

# 2. How the Web Works

## DNS: The Internet's Phonebook

DNS (Domain Name System) translates `google.com` into an IP address like `142.250.190.46`.

## HTTP/HTTPS: The Language of the Web

- **Verbs:** `GET` (give me data), `POST` (here is data), `PUT` (update data).
- **Headers:** These contain metadata (cookies, browser type).
- **Statelessness:** HTTP doesn't remember who you are. That’s why we use **Cookies** and **JWTs** (JSON Web Tokens). If you steal a cookie, you "become" the user without needing their password (Session Hijacking).

# Linux Fundamentals

## 1. The File System

| DIRECTORY | RED TEAM CARES ABOUT |
| --- | --- |
| /etc | Contains system configuration files. `/etc/passwd` lists users, and `/etc/shadow` contains encrypted password hashes. |
| /var/log | This is where your tracks are recorded. |
| /tmp - /dev/shm | These are world-writable. You’ll often download your scripts or exploits here because you have permission to write to them. |
| /root | The home directory for the superuser. |
| /proc | A virtual filesystem providing info about running processes. |

## 2. Permissions & Privilege Escalation

### Understanding the "RWX" bits

- **User / Group / Others:** Permissions are split into these three tiers.
- **Sticky Bits & SUID:** If a file has the **SUID bit** set (e.g., `rwsr-xr-x`), it runs with the permissions of the **owner** (often root), not the user who started it.

### Key Commands for Escalation

- `sudo -l`: Lists what commands your current user can run as root.
- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`: Finds all SUID files on the system.
- `id`: Tells you who you are and what groups you belong to (look for `sudo` or `admin` groups).

## 3. The Red Team Command Kit

- **`grep` / `awk` / `sed`:** For parsing massive log files to find passwords or IP addresses.
- **`ssh` & `scp`:** For moving laterally through a network and exfiltrating data.
