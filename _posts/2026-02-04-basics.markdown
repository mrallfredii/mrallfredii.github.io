## Networking

The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

* Physical Layer (Layer 1): Handles the physical transmission of raw bits (1s and 0s) over a medium (cables, Wi-Fi).

* Data Link Layer (Layer 2): Manages error-free data transfer between directly connected nodes, using MAC addresses.

* Network Layer (Layer 3): Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing data across different networks.

* Transport Layer (Layer 4): Ensures reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) data delivery between end systems, handling segmentation and reassembly.

* Session Layer (Layer 5): Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.

* Presentation Layer (Layer 6): Translates data, handles encryption/decryption, and compresses data for the Application Layer.

* Application Layer (Layer 7): The user-facing layer, providing network services for applications like web browsers and email clients.
